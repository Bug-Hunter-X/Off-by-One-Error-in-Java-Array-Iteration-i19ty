This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with an explanation of the fix.  This is a subtle error that can be easily overlooked but can lead to runtime exceptions. Understanding array indexing is crucial to avoid such issues.
